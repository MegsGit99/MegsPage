        I went to school in Preston at Archbishop Temple School. Here I attained 7 GCSE certificates. These include;
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Maths</li>
        <li>Science (Biology, Chemisty and Physics)</li>
        <li>English language and English literature</li>
        <li>Product design</li>
        <li>Drama</li>
        <li>Art and design</li>
        <li>History</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        I also did a level 3 business course at Preston College but unfortunately did not complete this. <br>
        I spent a year with Open University and gained first year in Criminology and Law. <br>
        I did not complete this as I figured that I wanted to pursue a future in technology, which led me to do my Level 4 apprenticeship in software engineering. 
        My employer is Places for People, where I will be completing my apprenticeship in the cloud engineering team.
