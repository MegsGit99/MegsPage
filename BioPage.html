        My name is Megan, I am 23 years old and I consider myself to be a creative and curious individual who likes to try new things.
        I have lived in Preston my whole life, however I have a keen interest in travelling. When I was younger, my Mum took me travelling around
        Asia to live with families that live in poverty, I learnt a great deal during this time. I have a huge bucket list of places to go before I die. Some of the places 
        I have already visited include; 
        
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Thailand</li>
        <li>Nepal</li>
        <li>Morocco</li>
        <li>Madrid</li>
        <li>Zante</li>
        <li>Cyprus</li>
        <li>Portugal</li>
        <li>Lanzarote</li>
        <li>Amsterdam</li>
        The list goes on!!
    </ul>

        I also am a huge fan of music. My song libary on apple music consists of 4,800 songs. I also collect vinyls. I have a very broad 
        taste in music. My favourite band is Red Hot Chilli Peppers. Music is something that I incorporate in all aspects of my life, 
        whether I use it to de-stress or set myself up for the day. I love to research music from all years, genres and is not typically popular.
        I know how to play the piano (basic), flute and clarinet. I am currently learning how to play the drums and want to learn how to play the guitar and harp.

        I am good at running and dance. In the past I have run for Preston Harriers and I used to do street dancing and pole fitness. I no longer pursue either of 
        these, however I am looking at getting back into both in due course given my new structured working week.

        I have a passion for animals and nature. I have a Jack Russell called Eddie who is my best friend. I love to take him on walks 
        and explore new areas in nature.
